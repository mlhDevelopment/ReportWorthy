Bookmarklets to fill the reporting gap in TrailLifeConnect.com

## How to use

I hope to make the easier in the future with more instructions, but for now you'll need to search the web for "how to install bookmarklet" and for each bookmarklet you want to use (currently there is only one) find it in the [bookmarklets](bookmarklets) folder and the entire content of the file is what goes into your bookmarklet - it already has the `javascript:` prefix and everything.
